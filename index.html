      <h1>Charles Massry</h1>
      <p>I am a web developer trying my hand at the full stack.
      I believe good ideas are the main drive behind every great innovation and although I can never come up with enough of them;
      I try my best and I am always open for more.
      I enjoy pasta, just not its programming brethren; baking comically difficult food, and homemade lattes.
      I am interested in politics, athletics, music, and using technology to improve them.</p>
